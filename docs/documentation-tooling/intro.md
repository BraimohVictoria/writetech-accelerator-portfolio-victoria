## What I Improved
- Made the setup guide clearer and easier to follow
- Broke long instructions into smaller, step-by-step sections
- Added simple examples for beginners to understand quickly

## Challenges
- Figuring out what parts of the old docs were confusing
- Making technical steps simple without removing important details

## What I Learnt
- Good docs are more about clarity than fancy words
- Even small changes in structure can make learning much easier
